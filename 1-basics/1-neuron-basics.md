# Neuron Basics
## Sigmoid Neuron
- Sigmoid function looks like this $F(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x})$.
- As of sigmoid neuron, it adds weight and bais to the function, and looks like this: $y = 1/(1+e^{-(wx+b)})$.
  - weight controls angle of the slope.
  - bias controls horizontal position of the slope.


## Identity Neuron
- Identity is a linear function looks like this: $y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b$.
